  <summary>How can I install and play with this?</summary>

---
First, you'll need to install tModLoader, which should be explained <a href="https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Usage-Guide">here</a>. Once this is done, make sure you restart Terraria; you should notice "tModLoader" with a version number somewhere on your screen, probably in the corner.

It is likely my mod is not published in the Mod Browser; in that case, on the main menu for Terraria (after tModLoader is installed), click "Mod Sources", then "Open Sources". 

Download this repository as a zip (in the bright green button "Clone or download" on the right side of the main repository page), then unzip the single folder into the sources folder. 

In Terraria, click "Build + Reload". You should now be able to enable or disable the mod in your Mods list. 

Have fun!

I've been following <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/tutorial-1-getting-started-with-tmodloader.44817/" title="Getting Started with tModLoader [Guide]">this guide</a>. tModLoader also has its own Discord channel where you can ask questions.
